This is a simple application i wrote to consolidate skills of working with DOM elements.

- #### Technologies
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Pure JavaScript(not using modules)

* #### Programming paradigm
  Functional programming
* #### App features

  It is a simple timer. You can start counting working time, short and long breaks. Also, you can start a cycle (work session of 25 mins and then a short break for 5 mins). Before that you can choose working session and break durations. The app can call you by playing a sound as the timer is done. Also I added some animations, so you can idenrify the timer's state looking at the color of elements.
