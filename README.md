Hello everyone! This is my second app called 'PomodoroClock' which i wrote using vanilla JS.
It is a simple timer. You can start counting working time, short and long breaks. Also, you can start a cycle (work session of 25 mins and then a short break for 5 mins). The app can call you by playing a sound as the timer is done. Also I added some animations, so you can idenrify the timer's state looking at the color of elements. Thank you for checking the app out!
